 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling = 15
print(schooling)

/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
schooling = 16
print(schooling)



/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
let explanation = "My method worked because I created schooling to be variable so I could change and update the value at will"
print(explanation)
